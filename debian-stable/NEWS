whoreirc (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  This release introduces a new headless client and a new PHP plugin for
  scripting (respectively whoreirc-headless and whoreirc-php binary
  packages).
  To avoid at least unnecessary dependencies, each plugin has its own
  separate binary package:
    whoreirc-{perl,python,ruby,lua,guile,javascript,php}
  Depending on your needs about scripting with whoreirc you should consider
  to install the missing packages.
